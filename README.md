Description:
Identification of a therapeutic target through microarray datasets for the TB-HIV coinfection state. The identified target was further explored using cheminformatics and machine learning to identify potent inhibitors capable of modulating the coinfection state.

**Description:**  
Identification of a therapeutic target through microarray datasets for the TB-HIV coinfection state. The identified target was further explored using cheminformatics and machine learning to identify potent inhibitors capable of modulating the coinfection state.  

**Methodology:**  
1. **Bioinformatics and Network Analysis:**  
   Gene expression analysis was performed on TB-HIV coinfected patient samples. Highly expressed genes were utilized to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, which was analyzed using various network descriptors. The analysis prioritized the most central and high-degree gene, identified as **EIF4A3**.  

2. **Cheminformatics and Machine Learning Modeling:**  
   A robust QSAR model for EIF4A3 classification was developed. The best-performing model was employed for virtual screening of anti-TB and HIV chemical libraries. The top-ranked molecules were further evaluated through structure-based approaches, drug-likeness assessment, and metabolite analysis, ultimately leading to the identification of two probable hits.
